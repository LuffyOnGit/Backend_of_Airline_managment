## Overview

![Overview Diagram](https://example.com/overview-diagram.png)

The Backend of Airline Management system is designed to manage and streamline the backend operations of an airline. This system is built using a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific function, such as searching for flights, booking flights, sending reminders, and managing user authentication. Each microservice is developed independently, allowing for flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance.

## Microservices

### Flight Search Service

The **Flight Search Service** is the cornerstone of the airline management system, enabling users to search for available flights based on various criteria such as destination, departure time, airline, and price range. This service is designed to handle a large volume of queries efficiently, using optimized algorithms to fetch and filter flight data. The service interacts with a central flight database and ensures that the most accurate and up-to-date information is presented to the user.

- **Key Features**:
  - Search flights by destination, date, and price range.
  - Sort and filter search results based on user preferences.
  - Supports caching for frequently searched queries to enhance performance.
  - Provides detailed flight information, including layovers, baggage allowance, and seat availability.

You can find the detailed implementation and code [here](https://github.com/s0nnygit/FlightsAndSearchService).

### Booking Service

The **Booking Service** is responsible for handling the entire flight booking process. Once a user selects a flight from the Flight Search Service, the Booking Service takes over to manage seat selection, payment processing, and booking confirmation. The service ensures that the selected seats are reserved in real-time, preventing double booking. It also integrates with external payment gateways to process payments securely.

- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time seat reservation and availability checks.
  - Integration with multiple payment gateways for secure transactions.
  - Generates and sends booking confirmation emails to customers.
  - Supports cancellation and modification of bookings.

### Reminder Service

The **Reminder Service** enhances the user experience by sending timely notifications and reminders to passengers. This service ensures that passengers are reminded of their upcoming flights, gate changes, delays, or cancellations. It can send reminders via multiple channels, including email, SMS, and push notifications. The service is highly customizable, allowing users to set their reminder preferences.

- **Key Features**:
  - Sends flight reminders and notifications via email, SMS, and push notifications.
  - Customizable reminder schedules and notification preferences.
  - Automatically detects changes in flight schedules and sends updates to passengers.
  - Integration with third-party notification services for broad reach.

### Auth Service

The **Auth Service** is the security backbone of the airline management system, managing user authentication and authorization. It handles user registration, login, and secure token management. The service uses industry-standard security practices to ensure that user data is protected. It supports role-based access control, allowing different levels of access for admins, agents, and customers.

- **Key Features**:
  - User registration and login with secure password hashing.
  - JWT-based token management for secure session handling.
  - Role-based access control for different user types.
  - Integration with OAuth providers for social login options.

You can find the detailed implementation and code [here](https://github.com/s0nnygit/AUTH_SERVICE).

## Installation

To run the entire system, clone this repository and follow the instructions for each microservice to set up the environment. Ensure you have Docker installed, as each service can be containerized for easier deployment.
